# Tetris in Rust

This is my Tetris coded in Rust.

On the first version of my tetris I followed a turorial based on Rust and Wasp but I didn't managed to understand and install Wasp so I had to restart from 0.

I restarted on a code that already exists to help me understand Rust and how to deal with it. My code misses some details Tetris has like the Score or the Music but there were things I didn't managed to understand so i prefered to have a code which I fully understand than a copy of another code that I can't explain.

It was difficult to start coding it without any Rust Basis but I'm proud of what I managed to understand and of how the result is.
